This repository contains unofficial Python quickstarts for [Timefold Solver](https://github.com/TimefoldAI/timefold-solver-python), an AI constraint solver. The Python solver has been [discontinued by Timefold](https://github.com/TimefoldAI/timefold-solver/discussions/1698#discussioncomment-13842196) and the original team is focusing on the Java and Kotlin solvers.
A roadmap to provide community support for Python is currently under review.

Priority for this repository is closing the performance gap between the Java and Python quickstarts by providing optimized solutions for all use cases.

- The original quickstarts have been moved to [legacy/](legacy/). These are based on unified Pydantic data models for API and constraint solving
- In [fast/](fast/) we are incrementally refactoring quickstarts to employ more efficient data models that limit Pydantic to API boundary validation to reduce overhead during solver moves
- In [benchmarks/](benchmarks/) we are running benchmarks to assess the performance of the different implementations

Current results are available in the [benchmarks](benchmarks/) directory:
- [Meeting Scheduling Benchmark](benchmarks/results_meeting-scheduling.md)
- [Vehicle Routing Benchmark](benchmarks/results_vehicle-routing.md)

You can also find our assessment of said results in [report.md](benchmarks/report.md).

Currently, *fast* quickstarts are available for the [employee-scheduling](fast/employee-scheduling-fast/README.MD), [meeting scheduling](fast/meeting-scheduling-fast/README.MD) and [vehicle-routing](fast/vehicle-routing-fast/README.MD) use cases, exclusively.

Being unofficial, this repository is not directly affiliated with Timefold AI, but maintainers are in touch with the Timefold AI team.

It shows different use cases and basic implementations of constraint solving in Python.

## Use cases

### 🚚 Vehicle Routing

Find the most efficient routes for vehicles to reach visits, considering vehicle capacity and time windows when visits are available. Sometimes also called "CVRPTW".

![Vehicle Routing Screenshot](legacy/vehicle-routing/vehicle-routing-screenshot.png)

- [Run vehicle-routing](legacy/vehicle-routing/README.MD) (Python, FastAPI)
- [Run vehicle-routing (fast)](fast/vehicle-routing-fast/README.MD) (Python, FastAPI)

> [!TIP]
>  <img src="https://docs.timefold.ai/_/img/models/field-service-routing.svg" align="right" width="50px" /> [Check out our off-the-shelf model for Field Service Routing](https://app.timefold.ai/models/field-service-routing). This model goes beyond basic Vehicle Routing and supports additional constraints such as priorities, skills, fairness and more.
